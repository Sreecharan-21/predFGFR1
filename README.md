# predFGFR1
predFGFR1 is a Machine Learning model of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor1 (FGFR1) inhibitors using Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) notation of Compounds
# CONTENTS
The files contained in the repository are as follows:
1. Prediction_program.Rda: Main script to run prediction
2. Smiles.smi: User input structures (multiple)
3. PaDEL_Descriptor: Folder with an executable for feature calculation
4. Training_Set: Training dataset
# REQUIREMENTS
## Data cleaning and manipulating
1. tidyverse
2. caret
## Feature Selection
1. Boruta
2. randomForest
## Model Development
1. e1071
2. nnet
# USAGE
In order to run FGFR1 inhibitor predictions, save input structures as SMILES in a single file (e.g. smiles.smi)
1.	Download this repository and ensure that all the files are present in the same folder when running the script
2.	A file containing the features generated by PaDEL will also be saved to disk (PaDEL_features.csv).
3.	Run Prediction_program.Rda
